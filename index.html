<p>Here is my remake of the 1982 Atari 2600 classic, Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em, for PlayStation 4.</p><p>Should work on exploited consoles running firmware 4.50 and above.</p><p>I have versions coming for Vita and Nintendo Switch as well which can hopefully get finished over the next few days or so.</p><p>What started as going to be a Switch only stage in the game, I have decided to include it in this build since it was just too funny not to.</p><p>I feel that the music included in this title was a huge driving force for me while developing and I am thankful for the talented work that those artists have provided the world.</p><p>This is obviously a satire remake, inspired by the original and I have no affiliation or endorsement from the rightful owners of the property or even provided awareness that I was working on this.</p>
